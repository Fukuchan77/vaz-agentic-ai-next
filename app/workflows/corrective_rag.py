"""Corrective RAG workflow using LlamaIndex Workflows.

Implements a three-step Corrective RAG pattern:
1. Search: Retrieve documents from vector store
2. Evaluate: Assess relevance and decide if retry needed
3. Synthesize: Generate final answer from relevant context

Each workflow.run() call gets its own isolated Context for state management.

The result cache (`ResultCacheMixin`), prompt-building helpers
(`PromptBuildingMixin`), and LLM-calling steps (`LLMCallMixin`) are split into
sibling modules per `.sdd/steering/file-size-policy.md`.

    """Corrective RAG workflow with retry logic and result caching.

    `ResultCacheMixin.run`'s signature is deliberately incompatible with
    `Workflow.run`'s at the type level (see `rag_cache.py`'s `super().run()`
    sites) - the mixin overrides `run` to interpose caching, not to satisfy
    `Workflow`'s own contract independently of this composition. Tracked as
    design debt (Protocol-typed mixin bases), not fixed here.

    This workflow implements Corrective RAG: after retrieval, an evaluation
    step assesses relevance. If results are insufficient and retries remain,
    a refined SearchEvent is emitted to trigger a new retrieval cycle.

    Implements TTL-based LRU cache for query results to reduce
    redundant LLM calls and vector store queries for identical requests
    (`ResultCacheMixin`, `app/workflows/rag_cache.py`).
