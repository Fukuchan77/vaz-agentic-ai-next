    This model tracks the progress and results of a single RAG workflow run.
    State is stored in the per-run LlamaIndex Context object to ensure
    isolation between concurrent workflow executions.

    Attributes:
        query: The original user query string.
        search_count: Number of vector store searches performed (incremented on each retry).
        max_retries: Maximum number of search retries allowed before giving up.
            Set to 0 to perform search only once without retries (internal use).
            Public API requires minimum 1.
        final_answer: The synthesized answer from the LLM, or None if not yet generated.
        context_found: Whether relevant context was found (True) or retries were exhausted (False).
        retrieved_hit_ids: Ids of every hit retrieved so far in this run (across all search
            attempts), used to validate that citations reference only ids actually seen.
