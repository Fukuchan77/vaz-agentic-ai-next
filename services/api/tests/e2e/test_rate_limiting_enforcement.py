"""E2E tests for rate limiting enforcement on API routes.

Verify that rate limiting is actually enforced on all routes.
Quick workaround (Option C): All routes including health checks have a 1000/minute
rate limit applied globally via SlowAPIMiddleware. This effectively exempts health
checks (they'll never hit 1000/min) while still providing protection on protected routes.
The `X-RateLimit-*` response headers always reflect this global default, regardless
of endpoint - LLM-invoking endpoints (chat, stream, RAG query) additionally carry
a stricter, configurable per-route limit (`settings.llm_rate_limit`, Req 11.3) enforced
via `enforce_llm_rate_limit` (app/middleware/rate_limit.py), which reuses the same
per-app `Limiter`/storage rather than a second, independently-headered one - so its
enforcement (a 429 once exceeded) is verified directly rather than via headers.

Tests verify:
1. Rate limiting headers are present and decrement correctly
2. Rate limiting is enforced (would return 429 after 1000 requests)
3. Health checks also have rate limiting but at same high threshold
4. LLM-invoking endpoints additionally enforce the stricter per-route limit (Req 11.3)
