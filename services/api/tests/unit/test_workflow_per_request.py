"""Tests for workflow instance caching and isolation.

Verify that get_rag_workflow() returns cached CorrectiveRAGWorkflow
instances across requests. Workflows are stateless (per-run state lives in
llama-index Context objects), so reusing them is safe and avoids rebuilding
Agent instances on every request.

Note: This supersedes the per-request isolation requirement.
