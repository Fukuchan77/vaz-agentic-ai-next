"""Unit test for Race condition in InMemorySessionStore.get_history().

This test verifies that _last_access timestamp updates happen inside the
session lock to prevent memory leaks when concurrent cleanup operations occur.

Bug location: app/stores/session_store.py line 153
The _last_access update happens BEFORE the session lock is acquired, creating
a race condition with cleanup_expired_sessions().

Race condition scenario:
1. Thread A calls get_history("session-1")
2. Thread A updates _last_access["session-1"] = time.time() (BEFORE lock)
3. Thread B calls cleanup_expired_sessions()
4. Thread B sees old _last_access timestamp, deletes session
5. Thread A acquires lock and returns empty list
6. Result: _last_access has fresh timestamp but session data is gone (memory leak)

Fix: Move _last_access update INSIDE the async with block.
