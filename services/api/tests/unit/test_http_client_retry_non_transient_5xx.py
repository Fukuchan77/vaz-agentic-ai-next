"""Unit tests for RetryTransport should not retry non-transient 5xx errors.

RetryTransport currently retries ALL 5xx errors (500-599) including
non-transient errors like 501 (Not Implemented) and 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported).
These are permanent errors that should not be retried.

This test verifies the fix: only {500, 502, 503, 504} should be retried.
