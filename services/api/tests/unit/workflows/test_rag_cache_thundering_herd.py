"""Test for thundering herd problem in RAG cache ().

The issue: When multiple concurrent requests arrive for the same query,
they all see a cache miss and execute duplicate LLM workflows because
the lock is released after cache check but before workflow execution.

This test demonstrates and verifies the fix using a "pending future" pattern.
