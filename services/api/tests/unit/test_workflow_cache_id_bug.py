"""Unit tests for - id() cache key bug fix.

(P1-HIGH): Tests for WeakKeyDictionary implementation.

These tests verify that using WeakKeyDictionary prevents id() collision bugs.

Note on GC behavior: The workflow holds a strong reference to vector_store
(via self.vector_store), so the vector_store won't be GC'd while the workflow
exists in cache. However, WeakKeyDictionary still provides benefits:
1. Prevents id() collision (different objects = different cache entries)
2. Allows automatic cache cleanup when both key and value are unreferenced
