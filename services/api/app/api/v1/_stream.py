"""Event-source generator for the agent SSE stream endpoint.

This module owns the agent-stream lifecycle guarantees: the `sse_max_events`
cap, `request.is_disconnected()` polling with resource release, a terminal
`error` event on exception, `asyncio.CancelledError` re-raise after cleanup,
closing the underlying async generator in a `finally` block, and a
`sse_send_timeout` timeout around producing each individual event so no
single stuck step (LLM call or tool execution) can hang the stream forever.

    Mapping: `ModelRequestNode` -> `StepStarted`; `PartDeltaEvent(TextPartDelta)`
    -> `Token`; `FunctionToolCallEvent` -> `ToolCalled`; the `End` node -> session
    save (if a session_id was provided) followed by `Completed`.

    When `chat_agent.output_type` is `NativeOutput` (Req 10.2), the model's
    streamed text *is* the raw JSON envelope, not user-facing text - text
    deltas are suppressed during the model-request node, and the parsed
    `ChatOutput.reply` is emitted as a single `Token` at the `End` node
    instead, so raw JSON never reaches the client.

    The run is wrapped in the same guardrails as the non-streaming chat path
    (Req 4.1/9.4: native `UsageLimits`, including `tool_calls_limit`; Req
    4.4-4.6: tool allow-list/approval/budget checks) via
    `build_guarded_toolset`/`agent.override`. A `GuardrailStopError`/
    `UsageLimitExceeded` raised here propagates out of this generator and is
    turned into a terminal `Error` SSE event by `_run_with_lifecycle_guards`.

    Per ADR-1 (same mechanism as `run_guarded`'s non-streaming path), `usage`
    is a caller-owned `RunUsage` that pydantic-ai mutates in place as the run
    progresses, so its counters stay readable after a `UsageLimitExceeded`
    raise even though the exception itself carries none - the caller passes
    the same instance to `_run_with_lifecycle_guards` so its consumer-side
    exception handler, which sits outside this generator's task, can read it.

    Args:
        chat_agent: The Pydantic AI chat agent to run.
        chat_request: The incoming chat request (message + optional session_id).
        deps: Agent dependencies (session store, settings, http client).
        history: Prior conversation history to seed the run with.
        settings: Application settings (usage_request_limit/usage_total_tokens_limit/
            usage_tool_calls_limit).
        usage: Caller-owned `RunUsage` passed through to `Agent.iter()`. A
            fresh instance is created when omitted (e.g. by call sites that
            don't need to read counters after the run).

    Yields:
