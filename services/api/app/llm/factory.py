"""LLM provider factory: eager FallbackModel chain + NativeOutput capability gate.

Wraps `app.agents.chat_agent.build_model()` (the single-model builder, still
the source of truth for the LiteLLM provider-routing logic) in a
`pydantic_ai.models.fallback.FallbackModel` chain, and exposes a model's
JSON-schema-output capability so the chat agent can gate `NativeOutput`
accordingly (Req 10).

    `evals.runner._build_judge_model()` (an independent judge model):
    both build a model other than `settings.llm_model` via
    `settings.model_copy(update={"llm_model": ...})`, which does not
    re-run validators.

    `llm_base_url` is provider-specific (e.g. an Azure OpenAI endpoint or a
    self-hosted LiteLLM proxy) — carrying it over unmodified when `model_id`
    names a *different* provider than `settings.llm_model` would silently
    point that provider's client at the wrong endpoint. It is preserved only
    when both share the same provider (e.g. two Ollama models against the
    same local server).

    Args:
        settings: The base settings, providing `llm_model`/`llm_base_url`.
