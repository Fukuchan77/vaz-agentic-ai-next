"""Agent execution guardrails: usage limits, tool allow-list, approval, and audit.

`run_guarded()` wraps a single `agent.run()` call with:
- native `UsageLimits` (token/request budgets, Req 4.1),
- a tool allow-list check (Req 4.4),
- an optional approval hook invoked before a guarded tool executes (Req 4.5),
- a token-budget check before executing any tool (Req 4.6, "side effects" per
  the spec clarification means every registered tool - Req 15's read-only flag
  is deferred),
- and an audit trail of every refused/denied/budget-blocked attempt (Req 4.7).

All three checks are enforced by wrapping the agent's own toolsets in
`_GuardedToolset.call_tool()` for the duration of the run, via
`agent.override(tools=[], toolsets=[guarded])` - the tool remains visible to
the model (so a scripted/hallucinated call to it is still dispatched to
`call_tool()` for auditing) rather than being hidden from its schema.
