    # be affected.

    # That trade-off is about *availability* of the health routes, and it must not be
    # read as a statement about their cost. `/health/ready` is unauthenticated and its
    # LLM check reaches a paid provider, so at this limit it would otherwise convert
    # inbound request volume directly into billable outbound volume - outside
