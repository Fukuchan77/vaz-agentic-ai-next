# PR #21 merge-readiness verification — code quality & security

**Target**: PR #21, `003-pydantic-ai-v2-migration` → `main`
(92 commits / 245 files / +27,934 −6,867). Merge base `956d9e2`, head `da720e9`.
**Date**: 2026-08-15
**Scope**: independent verification of `docs/003-merge-readiness-review.md`, from the
code-quality and security angles it claims to cover.
**Relationship to that document**: this is a second pass over the same branch, not a
rewrite. Everything below either confirms one of its findings against the code as
merged, or reports something it did not cover.

## 1. Verdict

**Do not merge as-is. Two security defects found in this pass are, in my
assessment, merge blockers — both of them in code this PR adds, and one of them in
the very function the prior review's BL2 fix touched.**

Everything the prior review claims to have fixed, it did fix: I re-derived each of
BL2, BL3, H1 and H2 against the working tree and all four hold. The problem is
narrower and more specific than "the review was wrong": BL2 restored trust in
`X-Forwarded-For` without fixing *which* element of that header is trusted, and the
readiness endpoint added by this PR turns an unauthenticated route into an LLM-cost
amplifier. Both bypass the `llm_rate_limit` control (Req 11.3) that this PR
introduces as its primary defence against LLM cost abuse.

| Class | Count | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Blocker (new) | 2 | V1, V2 below |
| Medium (new) | 3 | V3–V5 |
| Low (new) | 5 | V6–V10 |
| Prior review's findings re-verified | 4 of 4 | BL2, BL3, H1, H2 all confirmed fixed |

### Local verification runs (this pass, against the 2.x lock)

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `ruff check app/ evals/ tests/` | All checks passed |
| Types | `ty check app/ evals/` | All checks passed |
| Tests | `pytest tests/unit tests/integration tests/e2e` | **1490 passed, 23 skipped**, 7 warnings, 115.92s |
| Interpreter | `.python-version` / `.venv` | Python 3.13.12 (BL0's pin holds) |

The test count reproduces the prior review's own local figure (1490 / 23) exactly, on
a machine it never ran on — a useful independent confirmation that the suite is
deterministic and that BL0's interpreter pin does what it claims. With
`filterwarnings = ["error::DeprecationWarning"]` in force and an empty ignore list, a
clean run also re-confirms the deprecation census. Of the 7 surviving (non-deprecation)
warnings, one is a genuine defect — see **V10**.

## 2. Blockers

### V1. `X-Forwarded-For` parsing takes the **leftmost** entry, which is the one the client controls

`app/middleware/rate_limit.py:113`

```python
candidate = forwarded.split(",")[0].strip()
```

Once `_is_trusted_proxy()` says the immediate peer is a trusted proxy, this takes the
**first** element of `X-Forwarded-For`. In every proxy configuration this repository
documents, that element is supplied by the client, not by the proxy:

| Deployment | `docs/production_deployment.md` | Header semantics |
|---|---|---|
| Nginx | L64, L106: `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;` | **appends** — `$http_x_forwarded_for, $remote_addr` |
| AWS ALB | L277: `TRUSTED_PROXIES=["10.0.0.0/8"]` | **appends** the client address |
| Cloudflare | L318: the 15 published CIDR ranges | **appends**; `CF-Connecting-IP` is the trustworthy one, and L321 explicitly says the app reads only `X-Forwarded-For` |
| Apache | L197, L225: `RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"` | `set` **replaces** — the only documented target that is safe |

So a client sending `X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1` through the documented Nginx setup
produces `1.1.1.1, 203.0.113.7` at the app, and the app keys the rate limit on
`1.1.1.1`. Rotating that value gives the caller a fresh bucket per request.

Reproduced against this branch (`TRUSTED_PROXIES=["10.0.0.0/8"]`, peer `10.0.0.5`,
real client `203.0.113.7`):

```
client sent '1.1.1.1'    -> XFF '1.1.1.1, 203.0.113.7'  -> bucket '1.1.1.1'
client sent '2.2.2.2'    -> XFF '2.2.2.2, 203.0.113.7'  -> bucket '2.2.2.2'
client sent '3.3.3.3'    -> XFF '3.3.3.3, 203.0.113.7'  -> bucket '3.3.3.3'

distinct rate-limit buckets for ONE real client: 3
expected: 1 ('203.0.113.7')
```

**Why this is a blocker rather than a pre-existing wart.** Before BL2's fix, a
CIDR-configured deployment never trusted `X-Forwarded-For` at all — the failure mode
was *fail-closed* (every client collapsed into the proxy's bucket, which throttles too
much). BL2 correctly restored trust in the header, and in doing so it activated a
code path that was previously dead. The residual defect therefore changes character
with this PR: it is now *fail-open*. Both limits go with it — the global 1000/minute
`SlowAPIMiddleware` limit and the `llm_rate_limit` (default 30/minute) that Req 11.3
positions as the LLM cost-DoS defence — and the shared Redis storage of Req 11.4
makes no difference, because the key itself is attacker-chosen.

The function's own docstring states the opposite of what it does:

> - Prevents attackers from bypassing rate limiting by spoofing the header

**Suggested fix.** Walk the header right-to-left and take the first address that is
*not* itself a trusted proxy; fall back to `request.client.host` when every element is
trusted or none parses. `_is_trusted_proxy` and `_parse_trusted_proxies` already
provide everything this needs:

```python
if forwarded and _is_trusted_proxy(direct_client_ip, trusted_proxies):
    for candidate in reversed([p.strip() for p in forwarded.split(",")]):
        try:
            ip_address(candidate)
        except ValueError:
            # A malformed element means the chain can no longer be walked
            # reliably; stop rather than skipping past it.
            break
        if not _is_trusted_proxy(candidate, trusted_proxies):
            return candidate
    return direct_client_ip
```

`tests/unit/test_middleware_rate_limit_cidr.py` is the natural home for the regression
test; the case to pin is "client-supplied leftmost entry is ignored when a trusted hop
follows it".

### V2. `/health/ready` is unauthenticated and issues a real LLM request on every call

`app/api/health.py:104`, route at `app/api/health.py:111`

```python
await model.request(_PROBE_MESSAGES, _PROBE_SETTINGS, ModelRequestParameters())
```

`/health/ready` carries no `Depends(verify_api_key)` — deliberately, and
`tests/e2e/test_health_ready.py:38` pins that it is reachable without `X-API-Key`.
Every call makes a live, billable request to the configured provider (plus a Redis
round-trip when the Redis session store is enabled). The only bound on it is the
global default limit, which `app/main.py:86-95` sets to 1000/minute precisely so that
health endpoints are *effectively exempt*:

> Quick workaround (Option C): Accept that health endpoints will be rate limited,
> but set a very high limit (1000/minute) that effectively exempts them in practice.

That comment was written when `/health` returned a static dict. It is no longer an
accurate description of the risk now that `/health/ready` reaches a paid API. The
result is an unauthenticated endpoint that converts one HTTP request into one provider
request, at up to 1000/minute per bucket — entirely outside the `llm_rate_limit`
control that governs every *authenticated* LLM route. Composed with V1, the per-bucket
qualifier disappears too.

`max_tokens=1` bounds the completion cost, not the request cost: rate limits, per-request
minimum billing, and the connection load on the provider all scale with request count.

**Suggested fix**, in rough order of preference:

1. Cache the probe outcome for a short TTL (a readiness probe firing every 5–10s does
   not need a fresh provider round-trip per call). This keeps the endpoint
   unauthenticated and Kubernetes-friendly while capping provider traffic at a
   constant rate regardless of inbound volume.
2. Give `/health/ready` its own explicit, low limit rather than inheriting the
   "effectively exempt" 1000/minute.
3. Gate the LLM probe specifically behind `verify_api_key`, keeping the store probes
   unauthenticated.

Whichever is chosen, the `app/main.py` comment quoted above should be updated — it is
currently load-bearing documentation for a decision whose premise no longer holds.

---

## 3. Medium

### V3. The two halves of one rate-limit decision read two different `Settings` objects

`app/middleware/rate_limit.py:100` reads process-global `get_settings()`:

```python
settings = get_settings()
trusted_proxies = settings.trusted_proxies
```

while `enforce_llm_rate_limit`, 160 lines below in the same module, reads the injected
instance:

```python
settings: Settings = request.app.state.settings
```

So under `create_app(settings=...)` the *limit* comes from the injected settings and
the *key* the limit is applied to comes from the environment. `verify_api_key`
(`app/deps/auth.py:47`) has the same shape via `Depends(get_settings)`.

This is the exact substitution `CLAUDE.md` records `get_rag_workflow` as deliberately
refusing ("fails the request with a flat-envelope 503 … rather than substituting
process-global settings"), and Constitution Principle 4 is about the same boundary.
It is not exploitable today — the test fixtures keep both objects consistent — but it
means an injected `TRUSTED_PROXIES` is silently ignored, which is precisely the kind
of divergence that makes a future V1-style regression invisible to unit tests.

`get_client_identifier` is also used as slowapi's `key_func`, which receives only the
`Request` — `request.app.state.settings` is reachable from there, so the fix is local.

### V4. `/v1/rag/ingest` has no per-endpoint limit and writes to a store with no tenancy

`app/api/v1/rag.py:27` — authenticated, but carries no `enforce_llm_rate_limit` and no
principal binding. It writes into the single process-wide `app.state.vector_store`
that every RAG query reads from, and `ResultCacheMixin`'s cache is keyed only on
`(query, max_retries, vector_store.generation)`.

With one shared API key this is benign, and the prior review's Medium 4 already notes
that `derive_principal_id` currently yields one principal for all callers. The point
worth recording is the *constraint this places on that evolution*: the moment a second
API key exists, `/rag/ingest` becomes cross-principal corpus poisoning and the RAG
result cache becomes a cross-principal read. Session ownership (Req 11) was designed
for exactly that future and RAG deliberately sits outside it
(`app/api/v1/rag.py:88` — "RAG queries are session-less"). That trade-off should be
written down where the multi-key work will find it, not left implicit.

### V5. `AgentDeps.principal` is never populated

`app/agents/deps.py:27` documents the field (declared at line 35) as:

> `None` until session ownership (Req 11) resolves a real principal per request.

Req 11 ships **in this PR**, and `get_agent_deps` (`app/agents/deps.py:48`) still does
not set it. Both call sites that build an audit trail — `chat` and the SSE stream —
have a `Principal` in hand at the point they construct or read `deps`. The result is
that `AuditRecord`s (Req 4.7) carry no principal attribution, which is most of the
value of an audit trail once more than one caller exists. Either wire it through or
retire the field and its docstring; leaving a field whose comment describes a
condition this PR has already satisfied is the worst of the three options.

---

## 4. Low

- **V6.** `_DOCS_CSP` (`app/middleware/security_headers.py:39`) omits `object-src`,
  `base-uri`, and `frame-ancestors`, all of which `_STRICT_CSP` sets. Framing is still
  covered by `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and the relaxed policy is correctly scoped to
  the docs routes, so this is hardening rather than a hole — but the three directives
  cost nothing to carry over.
- **V7.** `InMemoryVectorStore._cosine_similarity` (`in_memory.py:562`) is dead in the
  query path after H2's fix; `_cosine_similarity_with_norms` replaced it. Keeping both
  invites a future edit to the wrong one.
- **V8.** H2's cache is populated by whichever query first misses it, with no in-flight
  de-duplication: N concurrent queries arriving after an ingest each build the full
  document-vector set in their own worker thread. The steady state is fixed (which was
  H2's actual claim), but the post-ingest burst still costs O(N × corpus). The RAG
  layer already solves the identical problem with `_pending_futures`
  (`app/workflows/rag_cache.py:150`).
- **V9.** `app/workflows/rag_prompts.py`'s module-level security note names role
  separation as "the fundamental protection", but both RAG agents
  (`app/workflows/corrective_rag.py:102,107`) are constructed with no system prompt or
  instructions — the instruction, the untrusted query, and the retrieved context all
  travel in one user message. `docs/owasp-agentic-llm-mapping.md:18` is honest about
  this ("LLM01 … Partial / accepted"), so the *documentation set* is consistent; it is
  the module note that reads as though the mitigation is in place. Aligning that note
  with the OWASP entry is a comment change, not a code change.
- **V10.** `tests/unit/agents/test_ollama_base_url_consistency.py:113` carries
  `@pytest.mark.integration`, but `integration` is not among the markers registered in
  `pyproject.toml` (`docker`, `benchmark`, `ollama`, `chroma`, `redis`). pytest emits
  `PytestUnknownMarkWarning` and the mark is inert, so the test runs in the hermetic
  `tests/unit/` lane — under `block_network()` — despite being labelled otherwise.
  Either register the marker, move the test to `tests/integration/`, or drop the mark.
  Worth noting that this is the one class of drift the repo's guard tests do not
  cover: `test_pytest_config.py` pins the `filterwarnings` entry but nothing asserts
  that every applied marker is a registered one, and `--strict-markers` is not set.

  Two other warnings in the same run are benign and expected: Logfire's
  `LogfireNotConfiguredWarning` (observability is deliberately optional) and
  `test_file_size_policy.py`'s review-band notice for `app/config/security.py` (516),
  `app/stores/vector_store/in_memory.py` (592), and `tests/unit/agents/test_guardrails.py`
  (652) — all under the 1000-line hard cap, all flagged by design.

## 5. What the prior review claimed, re-checked

| ID | Claim | Verified? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| BL0 | Python pinned to 3.13, guarded by a test on the *running* interpreter | Yes | `.python-version` = `3.13`; local venv resolves 3.13.12; `tests/unit/test_python_version_pin.py` present |
| BL1 | Branch CI now runs and is green | Yes (procedurally) | `pr.yml` triggers on `pull_request` → `main` **and** `push` → `main`; `cancel-in-progress` correctly conditioned on `github.event_name == 'pull_request'`; `timeout-minutes: 30` declared; all `uses:` SHA-pinned |
| BL2 | `TRUSTED_PROXIES` matched by CIDR containment, validated at startup | Fixed **as described**, but incomplete | `_is_trusted_proxy`/`_parse_trusted_proxies` and `validate_trusted_proxies` are correct; see **V1** for what the fix did not cover |
| BL3 | `.env.example`'s `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` placeholder now rejected | Yes | `_secret_placeholders.SHAPE_PATTERN` matches `<words>-here`; the four duplicated placeholder sets are genuinely consolidated into one module |
| H1 | Oversized ingest chunk → flat 422, not 500 | Yes | `MAX_CHUNK_CHARS` validator in `app/models/rag.py` **and** the `ValueError` → 422 catch in `app/api/v1/rag.py:61`; two-layer, as claimed |
| H2 | Document TF-IDF vectors cached, built off the event loop | Yes | `_doc_vectors`/`_doc_norms` with a `generation` guard on write-back; construction happens inside `_score_snapshot`, i.e. in the worker thread. See **V8** for the residual |
| H3 | Dependabot #17 / #12 closed, config prevents recurrence | Not re-checked | Procedural; outside a code review's reach |

The prior review's Medium items 1–5 all reproduce as described; nothing there is
overstated.

### Assessment of the prior review as a review

Its self-criticism is the most valuable part of it, and it is correct: calling BL1
("CI never ran") a *procedural* item was the error that let BL0 stay hidden, and the
document says so plainly rather than quietly rewording the original claim. The
documented correction of its own BL0 diagnosis — retracting the "eval agent structured
output" hypothesis once complete logs were available — is the right instinct too.

What it did not do is re-examine the *behaviour* of the code it changed once the change
took effect. BL2 is diagnosed precisely at the level of "the membership test never
matches" and fixed exactly there, but the question "and once it does match, is the
value we then trust the right one?" is never asked. V1 is what lives in that gap. The
same shape explains V2: `/health/ready` was reviewed as a feature (does it probe the
right dependencies, does it report correctly?) rather than as an attack surface (who
can reach it, and what does reaching it cost?).

---

## 6. Recommendation

1. Fix **V1** — right-to-left `X-Forwarded-For` walk plus a regression test in
   `tests/unit/test_middleware_rate_limit_cidr.py`. Correct the docstring's
   spoofing claim in the same change.
2. Fix **V2** — cache the LLM probe, or bound `/health/ready` explicitly. Update the
   "effectively exempts them" comment in `app/main.py` either way.
3. Fix **V3** — read `request.app.state.settings` in `get_client_identifier`.
4. Record **V4** and resolve **V5** (wire the principal through, or delete the field).
5. V6–V10 at leisure; none of them blocks.

V1 and V2 are both small, self-contained diffs in files this PR already touches. My
recommendation is to land them on this branch rather than defer them, because both
weaken the same control — `llm_rate_limit`, Req 11.3 — that this PR advertises as its
LLM cost-abuse defence, and merging as-is ships that control in a state where a
motivated caller is not subject to it.

---

## 7. Fixes applied

Items 1–4 of §6 are done. V6–V10 are deliberately left open.

### V1 — right-to-left `X-Forwarded-For` walk

`app/middleware/rate_limit.py::get_client_identifier` now walks the chain from the
right, skipping hops that are themselves in `trusted_proxies`, and returns the first
address that is not. A malformed element stops the walk rather than being skipped
past — everything to its left was relayed by something unverifiable, so resuming the
walk would resume trusting client-supplied values. When every element is trusted, or
the chain is unwalkable, the peer address is used.

The docstring's "prevents attackers from bypassing rate limiting by spoofing the
header" claim is now true rather than aspirational, and states the mechanism.

Verified with the same script that demonstrated the defect:

```
client sent '1.1.1.1'  -> XFF '1.1.1.1, 203.0.113.7'  -> bucket '203.0.113.7'
client sent '2.2.2.2'  -> XFF '2.2.2.2, 203.0.113.7'  -> bucket '203.0.113.7'
client sent '3.3.3.3'  -> XFF '3.3.3.3, 203.0.113.7'  -> bucket '203.0.113.7'

distinct rate-limit buckets for ONE real client: 1
```

Pinned by `tests/unit/test_middleware_rate_limit_forwarded_chain.py` (16 cases): the
Nginx appended-chain shape, bucket stability across a rotating claimed prefix, a
multi-hop chain with two trusted networks, the Apache replacing-proxy shape, an
untrusted peer, an all-trusted chain, a malformed hop mid-chain, and whitespace
variation.

One pre-existing test encoded the old semantics and was updated rather than deleted:
`test_handles_multiple_ips_in_forwarded_for` asserted the leftmost element of
`203.0.113.5, 198.51.100.1, 10.0.0.1` with only `10.0.0.1` trusted. It now asserts
`198.51.100.1` — the address the one trusted hop actually observed — and its docstring
explains why the leftmost element is not the answer.

### V2 — `ReadinessProbeCache`

`app/api/health.py` gains `ReadinessProbeCache`, built per application in
`lifespan._startup` from the new `readiness_probe_cache_ttl` setting (default 10s,
`0` disables). `/health/ready` serves probe results through it, so provider traffic is
a constant rate (one probe per TTL) regardless of inbound volume. The lock is held
across the probe, so a concurrent burst shares one run instead of each caller starting
their own — without that the cache would not survive the burst it exists for.

The endpoint stays unauthenticated and Kubernetes-friendly; an application built
without a lifespan has no cache on `app.state` and probes live, which is what keeps
the existing `MagicMock`-based unit tests exercising the probe path unchanged.

The `app/main.py` comment that justified the 1000/minute limit is corrected in place:
it is a statement about health-route *availability* and must not be read as one about
their *cost*, and any future unauthenticated route touching a metered dependency needs
its own bound.

Pinned by `tests/unit/api/test_readiness_probe_cache.py` (10 cases): repeat calls
within the TTL, a 50-call burst, 10 concurrent callers sharing one probe, expiry,
observing a status change after expiry, `ttl=0` restoring live probing, and cached-value
isolation from caller mutation.

### V3 — one `Settings` per decision

New `app/deps/settings.py::get_request_settings` prefers `app.state.settings` and falls
back to `get_settings()` only when `app.state` was never populated. `verify_api_key`
switches to `Depends(get_request_settings)` — its `settings` parameter name and
signature are unchanged, so the 15 direct-call tests keep working untouched.
`app/middleware/rate_limit.py` gains the equivalent `_resolve_settings()`, used by both
`get_client_identifier` and `enforce_llm_rate_limit`, so the key and the limit now come
from the same object.

The fallback is type-checked (`isinstance(settings, Settings)`) rather than a bare
`getattr`: unit harnesses build `app.state` from `MagicMock`s, which invent any
attribute asked for, and a stand-in must never silently become the configuration a
security check reads.

Pinned by `tests/unit/test_request_scoped_settings.py` (6 cases), including precedence
in *both* directions — injected settings win whether they are the more permissive or
the stricter side — plus the no-`app.state` fallback and the mock-rejection case.

### V4 — the single-key constraint, written down

Recorded as a dedicated section in `app/security/principal.py`'s module docstring, the
file any multi-key change must touch, naming both subsystems that are correct only
because one principal exists: `/v1/rag/ingest` writing to an unpartitioned store, and
the RAG result cache keyed without a principal. Restated in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
(edited as a pair, per the `004` convention) so it is reachable from the architecture
docs as well.

No code change: the constraint is real but not yet exploitable, and partitioning the
vector store per principal is a design change belonging to the work that introduces
the second key — not something to guess at now.

### V5 — principal attribution

`app/agents/deps.py` gains `bind_principal()`, called by both agent routes right after
`verify_api_key` resolves the caller. Binding at the route rather than inside
`get_agent_deps()` is forced: resolving the principal in the dependency requires
importing `app.deps.auth`, and that import closes a cycle (`app.deps` →
`app.deps.workflow` → `app.workflows.corrective_rag` → `app.agents.chat_agent` →
`app.agents.deps`). The constraint is documented at the field, at the helper, and in
both architecture docs, so the next agent route does not have to rediscover it.

Pinned by `tests/unit/api/v1/test_agent_principal_attribution.py` (4 cases), covering
both routes separately — they install their guarded toolsets independently, so a
binding on one proves nothing about the other.
