## Reverse Proxy Configuration

### Request Size Limits

**⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE**

The application's [`RequestSizeLimitMiddleware`](../app/middleware/request_size.py) only validates the `Content-Length` header. It **CANNOT** enforce limits on:

- Requests using `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (no Content-Length header)
- Requests that omit the `Content-Length` header entirely
- Malicious clients that lie about the Content-Length value

**This allows attackers to bypass the application-level size limit and cause denial-of-service attacks by sending unlimited request bodies.**

**SOLUTION**: Configure your reverse proxy or load balancer to enforce actual body size limits at the infrastructure layer.

---

### Nginx

Nginx is the recommended reverse proxy for production deployments due to its performance and robust body size validation.

#### Basic Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;

    # CRITICAL: Enforce maximum request body size
    # This applies to ALL encoding types, including chunked
    client_max_body_size 10M;

    # Optional: Return 413 immediately for large Content-Length
    # (faster than waiting for body upload)
    client_body_buffer_size 128K;

    # Optional: Timeout for client body upload
    client_body_timeout 30s;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Timeouts for long-running agent requests
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;
        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;
    }
}
```

#### Advanced Configuration with Rate Limiting

The application enforces its own rate limits independently of any reverse-proxy
configuration below: a global `1000/minute` default (`app/middleware/rate_limit.py`),
and a stricter, configurable per-route limit on LLM-invoking endpoints (`POST
/v1/agent/chat`, `/v1/agent/stream`, `/v1/rag/query`) via the `LLM_RATE_LIMIT`
setting (default `30/minute`, Req 11.3). When `REDIS_URL` is configured, the
global limit's storage is Redis-backed so it is shared across replicas (Req
11.4); the stricter per-route limit currently stays in-memory per process (a
documented trade-off, see `app/middleware/rate_limit.py`'s `enforce_llm_rate_limit`
docstring). Nginx-level `limit_req` below is a defense-in-depth layer in front
of these, not a replacement for them.

```nginx
# Define rate limiting zone (outside server block)
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=60r/m;

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;

    # Body size limit
    client_max_body_size 10M;

    location /v1/ {
        # Apply rate limiting
        limit_req zone=api_limit burst=10 nodelay;
        limit_req_status 429;

        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Disable buffering for SSE streaming endpoints
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;

        # Timeouts
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;
        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;
    }

    # Health check endpoint (no rate limit)
    location /health {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        access_log off;
    }
}
```

#### Trusted Proxies Configuration

When running behind Nginx, configure the application to trust the proxy's IP address:

```bash
# .env or environment variables
TRUSTED_PROXIES=["127.0.0.1", "10.0.0.0/8"]  # Adjust to your Nginx server IPs
```

This ensures the application correctly extracts the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` headers for rate limiting.

**This is a separate trust list from uvicorn's own proxy trust**, which controls
whether `Strict-Transport-Security` (Req 11.4) is ever emitted. `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`
emits HSTS only when `request.url.scheme == "https"` and never reads
`X-Forwarded-Proto` itself - that header is trusted (or not) entirely at the
ASGI-server layer, via uvicorn's `ProxyHeadersMiddleware`. The container image
sets `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=127.0.0.1` (the Dockerfile makes uvicorn's own
implicit default explicit rather than leaving it undocumented). Behind a real
reverse proxy, that default will not match the proxy's address, so
`scope["scheme"]` stays `"http"` and **HSTS is silently never emitted, even
though the client genuinely connects over HTTPS**.

Override it to your reverse proxy's actual address (a single IP,
comma-separated IPs, or a CIDR range) when running behind Nginx/ALB/Cloudflare:

```bash
docker run -e FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS="10.0.0.0/8" ...
```

Pair this with setting `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` in the same change: the
application logs a startup warning in any non-`development` environment while
`trust_proxy_headers` stays at its `false` default, so the deployment-level
trust list (`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`) and the application's confirmation flag
cannot silently drift out of sync.

---

#### SSE Streaming Considerations

`POST /v1/agent/stream` sends the [typed SSE contract](../README.md#pattern-3-sse-streaming) (`event:`/`data:` frames of `step_started`/`tool_called`/`token`/`completed`/`error`). The application already sets `Cache-Control: no-cache` and `X-Accel-Buffering: no` on the response, but the reverse proxy must not undo that:

- Keep `proxy_buffering off;` on the `/v1/` location (shown above) — buffering defeats streaming even with `X-Accel-Buffering: no` on some proxy configurations.
- Set `proxy_read_timeout` to at least `sse_send_timeout` (default 60s). The application emits an idle heartbeat comment every `sse_heartbeat_interval` seconds (default 15s) to keep the connection alive within that window; if you raise `SSE_SEND_TIMEOUT`, raise `proxy_read_timeout` (and `SSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`, which must stay ≤ `SSE_SEND_TIMEOUT`) to match.
- A single stream is capped at `sse_max_events` events (default 1000) and aborts with a terminal `error` event if no event is produced within `sse_send_timeout` — both are configurable via `.env`.

---

### Apache

Apache HTTP Server can also be used as a reverse proxy with body size validation.

#### Basic Configuration

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName api.yourdomain.com

    # CRITICAL: Enforce maximum request body size (in bytes)
    # 10MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 = 10485760 bytes
    LimitRequestBody 10485760

    # Optional: Limit total request line + headers size
    LimitRequestLine 8190
    LimitRequestFieldSize 8190

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/

    # Forward client IP
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "http"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Advanced Configuration with mod_security

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName api.yourdomain.com

    # Body size limit
    LimitRequestBody 10485760

    # Enable mod_security
    SecRuleEngine On

    # Additional security rules
    SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Length "^[0-9]+$" "id:100,phase:1,deny,status:400,msg:'Invalid Content-Length header'"

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/

    # Timeouts
    ProxyTimeout 60

    # Forward headers
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "http"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"
</VirtualHost>
```

---

### AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)

AWS ALB automatically enforces a **maximum request body size of 1MB for HTTP/1.1** and **10MB for HTTP/2** (as of 2024). No additional configuration is required for basic protection.

#### ALB Target Group Configuration

```yaml
# CloudFormation or Terraform example
TargetGroup:
  Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup
  Properties:
    HealthCheckPath: /health
    HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: 30
    HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds: 5
    HealthyThresholdCount: 2
    UnhealthyThresholdCount: 3
    Port: 8000
    Protocol: HTTP
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    TargetType: ip
    Matcher:
      HttpCode: 200
    # Deregistration delay for graceful shutdown
    DeregistrationDelayTimeoutSeconds: 30
```

#### Security Group Configuration

```yaml
SecurityGroup:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
  Properties:
    GroupDescription: Application security group
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    SecurityGroupIngress:
      # Allow traffic from ALB only
      - IpProtocol: tcp
        FromPort: 8000
        ToPort: 8000
        SourceSecurityGroupId: !Ref ALBSecurityGroup
```

#### Trusted Proxies for ALB

```bash
# .env - Trust ALB's VPC CIDR
TRUSTED_PROXIES=["10.0.0.0/8"]  # Adjust to your VPC CIDR
```

---

### Cloudflare

Cloudflare enforces request size limits automatically based on your plan:

- **Free Plan**: 100MB max upload
- **Pro/Business**: 100MB max upload
- **Enterprise**: 500MB max upload (configurable)

#### Cloudflare Configuration

1. **Enable "Under Attack Mode"** (optional) for DDoS protection
2. **Configure Page Rules** for API endpoints:

```
URL Pattern: api.yourdomain.com/v1/*
Settings:
  - Cache Level: Bypass
  - Security Level: High
  - Browser Integrity Check: On
```

3. **Rate Limiting Rule** (Business+ plan):

```
Rule Expression: (http.request.uri.path contains "/v1/")
Action: Block
Duration: 60 seconds
Requests per period: 100
```

#### Trusted Proxies for Cloudflare

Cloudflare's IP ranges change frequently. Use their [IP ranges API](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) or configure a wide range:

```bash
# .env - Trust Cloudflare IPv4 ranges (verify current ranges)
TRUSTED_PROXIES=["173.245.48.0/20", "103.21.244.0/22", "103.22.200.0/22", "103.31.4.0/22", "141.101.64.0/18", "108.162.192.0/18", "190.93.240.0/20", "188.114.96.0/20", "197.234.240.0/22", "198.41.128.0/17", "162.158.0.0/15", "104.16.0.0/13", "104.24.0.0/14", "172.64.0.0/13", "131.0.72.0/22"]
```

**Note**: Cloudflare sets `CF-Connecting-IP` header in addition to `X-Forwarded-For`. The application currently only reads `X-Forwarded-For`, which is sufficient for rate limiting.

---

## Security Hardening

### Environment Variables

**Never hardcode secrets in Docker images or code:**

```bash
# Use secrets management
docker run -d \
  -e API_KEY="$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id api-key --query SecretString --output text)" \
  -e SESSION_SIGNING_KEY="$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id session-signing-key --query SecretString --output text)" \
  -e LLM_API_KEY="$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id llm-key --query SecretString --output text)" \
  -e ALLOWED_HOSTS="api.yourdomain.com" \
  fastapi-pydantic-ai-agent:latest
```

### Host Header Validation

`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is **required** in `staging` and `production` - `Settings`
fails fast at startup if it's left at its `*` development default in either
environment. Set it to the hostname(s) this deployment actually serves,
comma-separated or as a JSON array (e.g. `api.yourdomain.com` or
`api.yourdomain.com,*.internal.yourdomain.com` for subdomains, using
Starlette's `*.example.com` wildcard form - not the Django-style leading dot).

This exists because Starlette's router rebuilds redirect targets from the
request's `Host` header (`redirect_slashes` defaults to on), so without a host
allow-list any caller can make the service emit a `Location` header pointing
at a host of their choosing - an unauthenticated open-redirect, reachable even
on unauthenticated routes like `/health/`. `TrustedHostMiddleware` (registered
outermost in `app/main.py`, ahead of even CORS) rejects any request whose
`Host` isn't on the list with a flat `400` before any other middleware or
route runs.

If this deployment sits behind a reverse proxy or load balancer (see Reverse
Proxy Configuration above), set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to the **public** hostname
your users connect to - not the proxy's internal address - since the proxy
forwards the original `Host` header through unless it's configured to
rewrite it.

### Session Ownership

`session_id` is server-issued, not client-supplied (Req 11.1/11.2): `POST
/v1/agent/chat` mints one (signed `{principal}.{token}.{signature}`, HMAC'd
with `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY`) when the request omits `session_id`, and rejects
a request presenting a `session_id` bound to a different API key with `403`.
`POST /v1/agent/stream` only authorizes an existing `session_id` this way
(the SSE wire contract has no field to mint and return a new one); omit it
there for a stateless, single-turn stream. `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` must be a
strong secret (16+ characters, same strength rule as `API_KEY`) - a weak or
shared-guessable key would let an attacker forge another principal's
`session_id` and defeat the ownership check entirely. Rotate it like
`API_KEY` (see API Key Rotation above); rotating it invalidates all
outstanding session ids, so plan rotations during low-traffic windows.

### HTTPS Enforcement

**Always use HTTPS in production.** Configure your reverse proxy to:

1. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
2. Enable HSTS headers
3. Use TLS 1.2+ only

```nginx
# Nginx example
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Strong SSL configuration
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256';
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # HSTS header (already set by app, but reinforce)
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

    # ... rest of configuration
}

# HTTP to HTTPS redirect
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

### API Key Rotation

Implement a key rotation strategy:

1. Use separate keys per environment (dev/staging/prod)
2. Rotate keys quarterly or after security incidents
3. Support multiple valid keys during transition periods

---

## Scalability Patterns

### Multi-Instance Deployment

For high availability, run multiple application instances behind a load balancer:

```bash
# Docker Compose example with multiple replicas
docker-compose up --scale api=3
```

**IMPORTANT**: When running multiple instances, **you must replace the in-memory stores with external services**:

#### Replace InMemorySessionStore

```python
# Example: Redis-backed SessionStore
from redis.asyncio import Redis
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage

class RedisSessionStore:
    def __init__(self, redis_client: Redis):
        self.redis = redis_client

    async def get_history(self, session_id: str) -> list[ModelMessage]:
        data = await self.redis.get(f"session:{session_id}")
        if not
            return []
        return [ModelMessage.model_validate_json(msg) for msg in json.loads(data)]

    async def save_history(self, session_id: str, messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> None:
        data = json.dumps([msg.model_dump_json() for msg in messages])
        await self.redis.setex(f"session:{session_id}", 3600, data)  # 1 hour TTL

# In app/main.py lifespan
redis_client = Redis.from_url(os.environ["REDIS_URL"])
app.state.session_store = RedisSessionStore(redis_client)
```

#### Replace InMemoryVectorStore

```python
# Example: Chroma vector store
import chromadb
from app.stores.vector_store import VectorStore

class ChromaVectorStore:
    def __init__(self, collection_name: str):
        self.client = chromadb.HttpClient(host=os.environ["CHROMA_HOST"])
        self.collection = self.client.get_or_create_collection(collection_name)

    async def add_documents(self, chunks: list[str]) -> None:
        ids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in chunks]
        self.collection.add(documents=chunks, ids=ids)

    async def query(self, query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[str]:
        results = self.collection.query(query_texts=[query], n_results=top_k)
        return results["documents"][0] if results["documents"] else []

    async def clear(self) -> None:
        self.client.delete_collection(self.collection.name)
        self.collection = self.client.create_collection(self.collection.name)

# In app/main.py lifespan
app.state.vector_store = ChromaVectorStore("fastapi-pydantic-ai-agent")
```

**Security note:** switching to `chromadb.HttpClient` (a standalone Chroma
server) makes CVE-2026-45830, CVE-2026-45831, and CVE-2026-45833 reachable —
cross-tenant collection read/write, an RBAC provider that never checks which
tenant/database/collection a permission applies to, and remote code execution
via a malicious model repo on the collections API. `mise.toml`'s `audit` task
ignores these three IDs today only because `app/stores/vector_store/chroma.py`
never uses `HttpClient` (embedded client only, no tenants, no RBAC). Deploying
a Chroma server as shown above requires revisiting that ignore list — none of
the three has a fixed release to upgrade into, so the mitigation has to be
network/access-control at the Chroma server itself (it exposes no built-in
authorization by default), not a version bump.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### Pydantic Logfire

Configure Logfire in production:

```bash
# .env
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your-logfire-token
LOGFIRE_SERVICE_NAME=fastapi-pydantic-ai-agent-prod
```

### Health Check Monitoring

Set up uptime monitoring on the `/health` and `/health/ready` endpoints:

```bash
# Example: Kubernetes
```

### Redis Key-Prefix Cutover Alerting

The pydantic-ai v2 migration bumped `RedisSessionStore.DEFAULT_KEY_PREFIX` from
`session:` to `session:v2:` (Req 7.1) so a v2 instance can never read history a
pre-cutover ("v1") instance wrote, and vice versa (Req 7.2). Pre-cutover keys are
not deleted — they are left to expire through their existing write-time TTL (Req
7.4), so the accepted cost of the cutover is that in-flight pre-cutover sessions
are dropped rather than migrated.

Because the two prefixes are mechanically isolated, a wire-format mismatch (a
pre-cutover payload read by v2 code, or vice versa, e.g. during a rolling
deploy or a rollback) cannot surface as one session reading another session's
history. Instead, `RedisSessionStore.get_history` treats it exactly like any
other corrupt payload (Req 7.6): it returns an empty history and logs

```
WARNING: Failed to deserialize session %s
```

rather than an error response, so the caller only ever sees an empty
conversation. That warning is silent to API clients and to the `/health/ready`
probe — **the log line's rate is the only signal a wire-format mismatch is
occurring at all** (Req 7.7). Alert on a rate increase, not on mere presence
(isolated deserialization failures from unrelated data corruption are
expected), for the duration of the cutover — i.e. until the pre-cutover
`session:` keys have fully expired via `session_ttl` (default 3600s) after the
last pre-cutover write. Remove the alert once that rollout window has passed.
